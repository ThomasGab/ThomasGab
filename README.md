- 👋 Hi, I’m @ThomasGab
- 👀 I’m interested in 3D printing, CAD, drones (FPV), video games, building stuff,...
- 🌱 I’m currently learning spanish and how to design small parts to print on a FDM printer
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on everything that includes moving parts and high technology. As a mechanical engineer I can mainly help on the hardware part of a project,
      but I am really interested in everything electronic.
